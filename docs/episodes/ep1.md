## 🎬 ACT 1 – Forgetfulness to Focus

### 🧠 Tip 1 — Start with Context (The Ghajini Rule)

**Concept:** Every chat is a blank slate; add scene‑setting.

**Differentiator:** Context turns generic output into _your_ situation.

**Try This (without tip):**

```
Write a post about morning yoga.
```

**Try This (with tip):**

```
I run a small wellness studio in Bengaluru. My audience is busy working professionals (25–40). 
I want a short Instagram post about how morning yoga boosts energy before work — friendly and simple.
Before you write, ask 3 quick questions you need from me. Wait for my answers before writing.
```

**Takeaway:** Context is your first tattoo.

---

### 🧩 Tip 2 — Define the Role (Give an Identity)

**Concept:** Role changes tone, logic, and focus.

**Differentiator:** Writing _as_ Joe’s coach ≠ writing _for_ Joe.

**Try This:**

```
You are a wellness coach for a neighbourhood yoga studio in Bengaluru.
Ask me up to 3 questions to tailor a 2‑line WhatsApp invite for our “Mindful Morning” session.
Only when I reply GO, release the final message.
```

**Takeaway:** Role = lens.

---

### 🎯 Tip 3 — State the Goal (Define Success)

**Concept:** Tell ChatGPT what “done” looks like.

**Differentiator:** Prevents wandering; improves alignment.

**Try This:**

```
You are a wellness coach.
Goal: Encourage 9–5 professionals to try a 10‑minute morning routine.
Ask me 3 quick questions. After I reply GO, produce a 3‑line Instagram caption.
```

**Takeaway:** Goal = north star.

---

### 🧭 Tip 4 — Add Constraints (Shape the Output)

**Concept:** Boundaries boost clarity.

**Differentiator:** Predictable length/tone/format.

**Try This:**

```
Write a WhatsApp invite for a free meditation class.
Constraints: ≤ 40 words, Hinglish, warm tone, ends with a friendly CTA.
Ask 2 questions first; release final only when I say GO.
```

**Takeaway:** Constraints = discipline.

---

### 🔢 Tip 5 — Ask for Numbered Options (Variety on Demand)

**Concept:** Explore, compare, choose.

**Differentiator:** You see patterns across options.

**Try This:**

```
Give me 3 Instagram hooks for a weekend yoga workshop. Rank by likely engagement. 
Ask 2 questions first; release final options after I say GO.
```

**Takeaway:** Options reveal what “good” looks like.

---

### ⚡ Tip 8 — Shortcut Commands (Fast Modes)
