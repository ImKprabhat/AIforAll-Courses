## Segment 1 – Why Most People Use ChatGPT Wrong

### Goal

Reframe how you think about prompts and stop using ChatGPT like a search bar.

> [!NOTE]
> **Tip 1: Don’t start with “Write me…”**

> ```
> 
> Instead, give context:

> You are a travel writer. Write a blog post about three unique Paris experiences for first‑time visitors.
> ```

**Tip 2: Avoid one‑liners; build role + task + tone**

```markdown

I want to create a compelling LinkedIn summary. What information do you need from me to help?
